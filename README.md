# assign3
CPSC 350, Assignment 3

STUDENT INFORMATION — Makenzie De Armas; ID: 2278709; dearm102@mail.chapman.edu

SOURCE FILES SUBMITTED — Delimiters.cpp // Delimiters.h // GenStack.h // main.cpp // Makefile // README.md //

ERRORS — The program cannot account for delimiters presented in areas non-essential to the code's function (comments, strings, stand-alone characters, etc.) due to the fact that different programming languages denote these elements differently. The program will treat any delimiters found in comments and strings, as stand-along characters, etc. the same as delimiters within the code, which will sometimes result in the program stating that there is an error in the code when there is none.
